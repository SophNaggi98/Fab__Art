      <h1>A BIT ABOUT MYSELF</h1>
      <p>
        After studying technical drawing, I dedicated myself to seeking out masters to learn the artistic disciplines, in which I always had a strong interest.
        I learnt the techniques of ceramic working from master Nino Rovo, then personally developed the various applications in both sculpture and pottery.
        In the studio of Prof. Claudio Romei, I learnt the techniques of marble working, such as full-round sculpture, Cosmato, Opus Sectile and Commesso Fiorentino.
       The production activity that would later become the most important one, was goldsmithing, learning from master Florindo Baiocco and for a long time, 
       all the necessary steps for making jewellery, from melting the precious alloys to finishing the objects.
        <br /><br />
        Finally, for about 20 years, I collaborated and worked with master Robert Cook, who passed away in 2017, learning all the techniques applied to bronze sculpture, 
        from the preparation of the wax amalgam to finishing with chiselling and patinas.
        Many solo and group exhibitions, including in Rome, Helsinki, Viterbo and numerous others. For about six years i was co-founder with other artists
        of the Artidec gallery in Bracciano, where many events are organised, including theatre, concerts, seminars and workshops.
        I currently devotes most of his activity to goldsmithing.
